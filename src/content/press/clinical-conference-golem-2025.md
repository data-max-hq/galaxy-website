Our Golem session united emergency clinicians with Galaxy’s field engineers to demonstrate how data parity keeps the coastline network resilient during seasonal surges. We modeled a full emergency scenario from first call to therapy delivery, pausing at each step to show how distribution teams provide predictive ETAs and alternative stock options.

## Infrastructure Upgrades
We previewed a “coastline topology” panel that now lives within the Galaxy Ops Portal. It fuses courier GPS, road closures, and live inventory, giving conference guests the first look at how we manage heat and humidity during summer.

## Community Impact
Golem’s municipal representatives endorsed the shared signal center, meaning that smaller clinics can now opt-in to the same alerting cadence as tertiary hospitals. The agreement formalizes the unified response structure ahead of peak tourist season.
