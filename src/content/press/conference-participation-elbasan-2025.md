Galaxy’s Elbasan delegation focused on how blended clinical teams can accelerate decision-making when faced with fast-moving rheumatology and neurology cases. The keynote illustrated how our pharmacists now integrate bedside labs, courier routing, and adverse-event logging into a single stream so that physicians never need to leave the patient record view.

## Field Insights
We showcased the telemetry ribbons installed across every Elbasan supply handoff. Those ribbons capture temperature drift, courier changes, and receiving signatures in real time. Physicians from the state hospital confirmed that the alerts already helped them intervene twice during April when delivery windows condensed unexpectedly.

## Collaborative Roadmap
Galaxy committed to co-designing an escalation tree for the municipal health department. The working group will map which cases qualify for fast-track diagnostics, which patients need remote monitoring, and what datasets can be anonymized for research. The framework will publish before August, providing a template for every hospital partner.
