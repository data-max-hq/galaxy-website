Galaxy’s PDMI framework gives institutions a clear scorecard for measuring how close they are to seamless therapy delivery. During the three-day conference we shared anonymized benchmarks, showing how hospitals can climb from “baseline” to “predictive” in quarters, not years.

## Workshops
Participants rotated through micro-sprints covering pharmacovigilance, climate resilience, and patient communications. Each sprint delivered a downloadable toolkit aligned with national reporting mandates, so teams can continue the work immediately.

## Partnership Announcements
Profarma’s lab leadership stood with Galaxy to confirm joint investments in biologic routing, unlocking faster release cycles for rheumatology and oncology therapies that need cryogenic handling.
