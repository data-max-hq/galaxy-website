The "Cases that speak" program invited specialists to narrate each case as a living story, surfacing hidden clues at every phase. Instead of delivering a static slide deck, our teams layered pharmacy data, rheumatology consults, logistics routes, and patient feedback in the same timeline, so that the full decision tree was visible to the audience.

## Narrative Evidence
Participants could vote on the next clinical decision using their devices, and the aggregated results were projected live. The exercise exposed where assumptions typically diverge, allowing our facilitators to highlight the exact data point that unblocked each real-world case.

## Operational Commitments
Following the session, Galaxy published a lightweight template that helps partner clinics map similar narratives in under thirty minutes. The template is now part of our onboarding kit, enabling any facility to capture diagnostic cues, therapy adjustments, and logistics interventions without new software licenses.
