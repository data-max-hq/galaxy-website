The Clinical Overview broadcast assembled case leads from rheumatology, oncology, and neurology programs to reveal how each service line documented “aha” moments. Instead of stretching the truth, we highlighted missteps and recovery tactics so that teams could see how our escalation policies actually operate on the ground.

## Case Libraries
Every case breakdown showed the original physician notes, courier telemetry, and follow-up labs in a synchronous dashboard. The exercise underscored how much signal resides outside the EMR and how Galaxy’s distribution vantage point can fill those gaps.

## Policy Outcomes
Attendees voted to adopt a new rule: any cold-chain alert will now trigger an automatic case huddle within four hours, regardless of whether the therapy has already been administered. This safeguard is being encoded into our compliance portal before summer.
