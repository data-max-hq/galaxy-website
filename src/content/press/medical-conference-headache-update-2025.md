Galaxy neurologists and operations strategists co-presented at the Headache Update conference to outline why logistics precision is a first-line therapy. We charted anonymized migraine trajectories, showing how each additional hour without the indicated biologic compounds patient discomfort and emergency risk.

## Delivery Innovations
We shared how Hilton Garden Inn served as a remote command center for after-hours deliveries. Couriers staged in the parking hub, allowing us to redeploy therapies closest to where patients live. This experiment shortened average delivery windows by 38 minutes across Tirana.

## Neurology Support
Galaxy announced that pharmacists will now join neurology clinics virtually during complex titrations. The presence of a distribution expert ensures drug interactions, replenishment needs, and cold-chain logistics are resolved before the patient leaves the exam room.
