Galaxy concluded 2024 by partnering with the Albanian Society of Rheumatic Diseases to showcase measurable access progress. The Rheumatic Access Barometer combined prescription data, reimbursement approvals, and courier statistics to reveal where patients still experience friction.

## Shared Services
To address those gaps, Galaxy and the Society launched a pharmacovigilance help desk that clinics can contact 24/7. The desk links pharmacists, logisticians, and regulatory experts, ensuring each adverse-event report or replenishment request gets handled without duplication.

## Looking Ahead
We pledged capital investments across northern cold-chain depots so that 2025 pilot therapies can move without delay. This commitment was well received by hospital directors who want to place advanced infusions closer to rural patients.
