This bespoke event allowed rheumatologists to sit beside Galaxy engineers and walk through each signal that determines whether a therapy arrives within hours or days. We broke down typical bottlenecks, such as manual paperwork or fragmented courier requests, and showed how automation removes friction without compromising regulation.

## Simulation Labs
Attendees rotated through live demo pods where they could request a therapy, watch the order propagate through our system, and observe how exception management kicks in when a vial temperature drifts. Seeing the entire cycle demystified the invisible work our distribution teams complete for every patient.

## Mentorship Impact
Galaxy committed to sponsoring a mentorship cohort that pairs early-career rheumatologists with operations specialists. The group will shadow cases through Q4 and share learnings through the new Rheumatology Signal Brief newsletter.
