Team Galaxy traveled north with a singular goal: give clinics a transparent look at how critical therapies traverse mountainous corridors and border checkpoints. The meeting transformed into a strategic lab where public and private stakeholders co-authored the new charter in real time.

## Quality Guarantees
We committed to publishing weekly quality digests that summarize cold-chain performance, on-time arrivals, and outstanding corrective actions. The digest structure was co-created with hospital QA leads, ensuring the data is actionable for their boards.

## Expansion Path
With the charter in place, Shkodra can now host future specialty clinics that rely on delicate room-temperature bands. Galaxy will extend its monitoring mesh to new spokes over summer so patients never feel the geography gap.
