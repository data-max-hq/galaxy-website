At the XII Albanian Rheumatology Conference we lifted the curtain on RheumaGuard, a comprehensive oversight program that tracks biologic journeys from central warehouse to bedside infusion. The program bundles logistics telemetry, nurse check-ins, and patient education touchpoints.

## Safeguards
RheumaGuard uses machine learning to flag any shipment that deviates from planned humidity or vibration thresholds. Those alerts instantly notify the assigned clinical liaison, who can authorize a replacement and inform the treating physician.

## Adoption Strategy
Our analysts also shared the 2025 biosimilar adoption curve, demonstrating where price relief and increased availability will surface first. The session spurred new collaborations with hospitals eager to extend advanced therapies to more patients without compromising care gaps.
