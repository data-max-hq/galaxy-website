Galaxy has opened two new distribution hubs that are fully compliant with GDP standards and equipped with validated cold-chain corridors. These investments make sure oncology, biologic, and rare-disease therapies move swiftly while preserving their integrity.

With local pharmacists and hospital partners demanding faster turnaround, the upgraded network shortens delivery times by 38% compared to 2022. It also provides real-time telemetry for temperature-sensitive shipments so partners can trace inventory conditions at any moment.
