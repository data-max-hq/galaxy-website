As Albania accelerates alignment with EU pharmaceutical directives, Galaxy and Profarma continue to invest in the regulatory infrastructure that keeps medicines available without interruption. Every submission is handled by a cross-functional team that blends local insight with EU procedural rigor.

Profarma's dossier lifecycle management now includes structured data rooms, enabling authorities to trace every update, commitment, and pharmacovigilance report. This transparency is a cornerstone of our promise to bring novel therapies to market responsibly.
