Quality management at scale requires proactive insight. Galaxy's new digital layer feeds telemetry from warehouses, vehicle fleets, and partner pharmacies into a single command view reachable by our QA specialists.

The system targets anomalies such as prolonged door openings or vibration spikes, triggering corrective workflows long before product integrity is threatened. Partners see the same dashboards, reinforcing joint accountability across the supply chain.
